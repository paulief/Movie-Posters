This is a basic Rails app that allows the user to enter a movie title and year and get the poster for the movie. It uses the Netflix Roulette API (https://market.mashape.com/community/netflix-roulette).

To run the server locally, clone this repo and run `bundle install`, then `rails server`.

It is deployed on Heroku at https://ancient-hamlet-78514.herokuapp.com
